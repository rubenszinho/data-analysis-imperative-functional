# Assignment 2
This repository contains a Java project focused on data analysis using both imperative and functional programming paradigms. The project aims to explore different approaches to data analysis and compare the advantages and disadvantages of imperative and functional programming in this context.

## Version 1

Implementation in Java using streams and without the use of loops. In this version, the presence of any loop structure in the program will result in a zero score for this item. The objective is to obtain:

- The sum of the "Active" value for all countries where the "Confirmed" value is greater than or equal to n1.
- Among the n2 countries with the highest "Active" values, obtain the "Deaths" value for the n3 countries with the lowest "Confirmed" values.
- The n4 countries with the highest "Confirmed" values, in alphabetical order.

## Version 2

Implementation in Java using loops and without the use of streams. In this version, functional programming concepts should not be used. The objective is to obtain the same results described in Version 1.
